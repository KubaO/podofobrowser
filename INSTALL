Building PoDoFoBrowser - Dependencies
*************************************

podofobrowser svn generally requires PoDoFo svn to build and run. You will also
need an installed copy of TrollTech's Qt library. Linux users should make sure
the -dev or -devel package for Qt is installed too.

On windows, both Visual Studio (versions 8 and 9 tested) and MinGW are supported.
Use CMake to generate a project file (VC++) or makefile (MinGW).

Note that because the gcc and MSVC++ C++ APIs are incompatible (as are the ABIs
of most other C++ compilers) you must build podofobrowser with the same
compiler you used to build podofo. Unless you have a reason to do something
else, use the version of PoDoFo that was automatically checked out into
externals/required_libpodofo as part of your PoDoFoBrowser checkout.

*************************************
  Building PoDoFoBrowser with CMake
*************************************

The Qt4 port of PoDoFoBrowser is best built with CMake version 2.4 or newer
(CMake 2.5 from CMake CVS is best).

cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" \
	-DLIBPODOFO_DIR=/path/to/podofo_install_dir \
	-DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/path/to/extra/includes \
	-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/extra/libraries

Windows users can also build PoDoFoBrowser using CMake. You will need an
installed copy of PoDoFo and will need to have Qt 4.3.2 or 4.4 installed. Set
QTDIR to point to your Qt install directory, ensure MinGW is on your PATH, and
make sure to set CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH and CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the same
libraries you used to build PoDoFo against (important!). LIBPODOFO_DIR should
point to the PoDoFo installation directory (NOT the build directory, which WILL
NOT WORK).

SET QTDIR=c:\qt\4.2.1
SET PATH=c:\mingw\bin;%PATH%
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles"
	-DLIBPODOFO_DIR=c:\developer\podofo_install_dir
	-DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=c:\progra~1\gnuwin32\include
	-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=c:\progra~1\gnuwin32\lib

If you want to use Visual Studio, just change the -G argument from "MinGW Makefiles"
to one appropriate for your Visual Studio version (eg "Visual Studio 8 2005").
To find out which targets are supported by your version of cmake, run it
without any arguments.

Windows users MUST also set -DLIBPODOFO_SHARED to 0 if building against a
static library, or to 1 if building against a PoDoFo DLL. This ensures the
correct import symbols are used, preventing confusing link errors.

To control where PoDoFoBrowser will be installed (with "make install" on
supporting toolchains), set:
	-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/dir

If you want a debuggable build, set -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug .

*************************************
    Troubleshooting CMake Builds
*************************************

If you have any problems building PoDoFoBrowser with CMake, please delete your
out-of-tree build directory and try again. If you are using in-tree builds,
remove CMakeCache.txt and the CMakeFiles directory instead.
