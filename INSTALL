*************************************
Building PoDoFoBrowser - Dependencies
*************************************

podofobrowser svn generally requires PoDoFo svn to build and run. You will also
need an installed copy of TrollTech's Qt library. Linux users should make sure
the -dev or -devel package for Qt is installed too.

Windows users will need the MinGW compilation environment. The Qt installer will
download and install this for you if you don't already have it.

The open source version of Qt4 does not support building with Visual Studio.
PoDoFoBrowser should build fine with CMake and Visual Studio if you are using
a version of Qt that supports this configuration. Please report any issues with
this process, as the authors do not have easy access to this configuration.

Note that because the gcc and MSVC++ C++ APIs are incompatible (as are the ABIs
of most other C++ compilers) you must build podofobrowser with the same
compiler you used to build podofo. Unless you have a reason to do something
else, use the version of PoDoFo that was automatically checked out into
externals/required_libpodofo as part of your PoDoFoBrowser checkout.

*************************************
  Building PoDoFoBrowser with CMake
*************************************

The Qt4 port of PoDoFoBrowser is best built with CMake version 2.4 or newer
(CMake 2.5 from CMake CVS is best).

cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" \
	-DLIBPODOFO_DIR=/path/to/podofo_install_dir \
	-DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/path/to/extra/includes \
	-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/extra/libraries

Windows users can also build PoDoFoBrowser using CMake. You will need an
installed copy of PoDoFo and will need to have Qt 4 installed. Set QTDIR to
point to your Qt install directory, ensure MinGW is on your PATH, and make sure
to set CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH and CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the same libraries
you used to build PoDoFo against (important!). LIBPODOFO_DIR should point to the
PoDoFo installation directory (NOT the build directory, which WILL NOT WORK).

SET QTDIR=c:\qt\4.2.1
SET PATH=c:\mingw\bin;%PATH%
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles"
	-DLIBPODOFO_DIR=c:\developer\podofo_install_dir
	-DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=c:\progra~1\gnuwin32\include
	-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=c:\progra~1\gnuwin32\lib

Windows users MUST also set -DLIBPODOFO_SHARED to 0 if building against a
static library, or to 1 if building against a PoDoFo DLL. This ensures the
correct import symbols are used, preventing confusing link errors.

Note that PoDoFoBrowser currently only builds against an installed copy of
PoDoFo, not the podofo build tree.

To control where PoDoFoBrowser will be installed (with "make install" on
supporting toolchains), set:
	-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/dir

If you want a debuggable build, set -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug .

*************************************
    Troubleshooting CMake Builds
*************************************

If you have any problems building PoDoFoBrowser with CMake, please delete your
out-of-tree build directory and try again. If you are using in-tree builds,
remove CMakeCache.txt and the CMakeFiles directory instead.
