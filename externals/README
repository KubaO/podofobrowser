This directory contains references to external repositories or other parts
of the PoDoFoBrowser repository that will be checked out and updated in sync
with PoDoFoBrowser. Its contents are controlled with the svn:externals property.

See: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07s04.html

We currently use this to make sure that PoDoFoBrowser svn users get a version
of PoDoFo that's compatible with the current PoDoFoBrowser code base. As
PoDoFo is improved we often break API compatibility in the development series,
and while this is usually for important fixes it still requires some adaptation to make PoDoFoBrowser compile and run with the new version of PoDoFo. To help
users, the latest PoDoFo that was tested with PoDoFoBrowser will be checked out
in externals/required_podofo .
