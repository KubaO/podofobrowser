	**WARNING**
This version of PoDoFoBrowser is under heavy development and is not suitable
for production use. You should get the latest from podofobrowser/branches/qt4,
or the latest public PoDoFoBrowser release, for a more stable build.



PoDoFoBrowser is a Qt 4 application for browsing the objects in a PDF file and
modifying their keys easily. It is very useful if you want to look on the
internal structure of PDF files.

You will need Qt4 and PoDoFo to build PoDoFoBrowser. CMake is used as the build
system (see the INSTALL file for details), though you can use qmake if you prefer.
