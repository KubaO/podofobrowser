PoDoFoBrowser is a Qt 4 application for browsing the objects in a PDF file and
modifying their keys easily. It is very useful if you want to look on the
internal structure of PDF files.


***** WARNING *****
This version of PoDoFoBrowser is under heavy development and is not suitable
for production use. You should get the latest from:
https://podofo.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/podofo/podofobrowser/branches/qt4port
or the latest public PoDoFoBrowser release, for a more stable build.
***** WARNING *****

You will need Qt version 4.2.0 or newer and PoDoFo to build PoDoFoBrowser.
CMake is used as the build system (see the INSTALL file for details), though
you can use qmake if you prefer.

A recent copy of PoDoFo svn is required to compile this version of
PoDoFoBrowser. The best way to make sure you have a compatible version of
PoDoFo is to use the version automatically checked out for you in
externals/required_podofo . This version has been confirmed to build and work
with the PoDoFoBrowser revision you're checking out. Since we do make
API-incompatible changes to PoDoFo during the development series, using this
version will save you some fuss. There is NO build integration at this point,
so you must build and install required_podofo before building PoDoFoBrowser.
